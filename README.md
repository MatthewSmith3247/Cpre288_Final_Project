## Story
Briefing: RescueBot is an innovative assistive robot designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate new and cluttered indoor environments. Inspired by the functionality of a service animal, RescueBot offers a cost-effective and accessible alternative. Using a combination of IR and Ping sensors, audio feedback, and voice command capabilities, RescueBot provides users with confidence and independence in their mobility.

Our project leverages the capabilities of the iRobot Create platform, integrating custom software, hardware, and sensors to deliver real-time navigation assistance. RescueBot is designed to detect and avoid obstacles, guide users safely, and provide intuitive voice-based interaction.

## Problem Statement
For visually impaired individuals, navigating new environments can be challenging and often requires service animals or caregiversâ€”resources that are either expensive or inaccessible to many. RescueBot bridges this gap by providing a reliable and affordable alternative, enabling users to move independently while receiving constant audio feedback about their surroundings.

## Functional Requirements
RescueBot incorporates the following features:

### Obstacle Detection and Navigation
* Scans the environment using IR and Ping sensors mounted on a 180-degree servo.
* Detects and avoids obstacles, rerouting when necessary to ensure a safe path.
  
### Audio Feedback
*  Provides clear, friendly voice feedback about detected objects and navigation updates.
*  Adjustable audio output to suit different environments.

### Voice Commands
* GUI-based interface to accept and execute user commands for destination and mode selection.
* Allows intuitive interaction for users with limited vision.

### PathFinding
* Incorporates a robust pathfinding algorithm to navigate safely in cluttered environments.

### Accurate Object Positioning
* Accurately positions detected objects on the GUI map, enhancing user awareness.
* Simulated on DesMos

### Internal Measurement Unit Integration
* Utilizes an Internal Measurement Unit bno055 (IMU) for precise movement control via PID algorithms.
* Communicates with the IMU using the I2C protocol.
